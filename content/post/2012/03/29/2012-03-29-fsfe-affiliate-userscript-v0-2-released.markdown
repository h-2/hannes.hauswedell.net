I decided to rewrite the script.

What's new:
	
* only one 5-line function from another script is used, the rest is original code under CC0 / Public Domain

	
* Amazon code is cleaner, should produce less false-positive replacements (in theory ;) )
	
* Support for Libri.de / Bookzilla.de is added. Any and all links to Libri are replaced with links to Bookzilla. Actions on Libri.de itself are also "transferred".

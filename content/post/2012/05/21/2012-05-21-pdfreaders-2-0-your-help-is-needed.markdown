Hi everyone,



we are currently preparing a major update to PDFReaders.org, adding:

* a more appealing and cleaner "home"-page, with **one recommendation** for the auto-detected platform


* Free pdf reader recommendations for mobile platforms


* Free pdf browser plugin recommmendations



  



BUT, we need some help with gathering/verifying information, deciding what to recommend... 

<!-- more -->



Please have a look at the current [Reader-Overview](https://wiki.fsfe.org/PDFreaders/todo2012/Overview-Page) and the TODOs there.





Please tell us...

* if you know any other Free pdf readers that we haven't listed, yet (for any plaform, but especially OSX and iOS)


* which Android reader you would recommend


* any other ideas you might have!



  



You can reach us via [mail](mailto:feedback(@)pdfreaders(.)org) or comment directly in the [blog](/post/2012/05/21/pdfreaders-2-0-your-help-is-needed/). If you have an account at the [fellowship-wiki](https://wiki.fsfe.org/) you can commit changes to the overview directly.




Thanks for your help!

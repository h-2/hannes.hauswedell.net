I have just backed a wonderful looking independent dystopian RPG on Kickstarter! It's called [Insomnia](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1892480689/insomnia-an-rpg-set-in-a-brutal-dieselpunk-univers), it looks like it uses the Free Software Engine [Ogre3d](http://www.ogre3d.org/) (although its not Free Software itself) and it will feature native Linux support. They still need money, so if you enjoy special video games, go help them out and pre-order your DRM-free copy!

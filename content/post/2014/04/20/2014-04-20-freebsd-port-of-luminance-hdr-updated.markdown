I finally managed to update [graphics/luminance](http://www.freshports.org/graphics/luminance/) to 2.3.1. Thanks to lme@freebsd and pawel@freebsd for feedback and commit.
<!-- more -->

This is last version that runs with Qt4. As we recently got Qt5 into the ports I will try to update the port soon again. I also have some new ports coming and hope to get around to fixing/updating my other ones. Stay tuned.

I am making strong use of [RedPorts](http://www.redports.org) now. In case you don't know the service, I really recommend it.

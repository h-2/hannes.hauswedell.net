Since I have had more and more spam coming through the filters and annoying me no end, I decided to restrict commenting to registered users (which are only FSFE fellows). I regret to do this, but the ratio of spam to content is 5,245 to 22 (do the math yourself) and I don't want to spend what time I have for the blog with removing spam. I hope to change it in the future again, once a better anti-spam solution has been found.

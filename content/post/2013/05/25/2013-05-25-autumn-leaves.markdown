This is my current wallpaper on my desktop. Not a winter picture, but autumn is ok, too. I took the picture in Brandenburg in fall of 2011. Had I had more time, I might have taken some better ones, because the light was really great. I would really have liked to make one without the »Hochstand« (high seat?). But actually I was quite in a hurry, because there were other people walking in the forest, and the picture was taken just when the person in front of me was concealed by a tree.

The only editing done on the picture is manual contrast/gamma correction and transformation to black-and-white with a green filter. I might post a tutorial on the digikam workflow involved with making this picture, if you are interested in that, let me know.
